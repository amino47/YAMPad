# My Struggles
One of my major struggles when designing this project was making the case, as I am very new to CAD.
I mainly struggled with aligning the measurements and cutouts between the top and bottom sections of the case.
I probably spent at least 40% of the time making this project on just designing the case.
I eventually managed to align the cutout for the MCU on both pieces of the case.
